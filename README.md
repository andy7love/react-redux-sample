- Async actions (simulate delay on "server" responses for this).
- Custom-Hooks
- Jest + Jest-styled-components

Scalable folder and component architecture structure was inspired by [this article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/structure-your-react-redux-project-for-scalability-and-maintainability-618ad82e32b7) and [this other](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be/).

# Create React App Readme

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
